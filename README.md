# [Shinobi](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PlgJJjFsImaM9uoWc6DfPCXohPMRKuCX#scrollTo=zKbIWlOcy21T) is a python language platform that houses two programs that are described below

## Collision Cross Section Approximation 
#### This program uses experimentally derived linear or polynomial interpolation to approximate and predict new peptide collision cross section values. Thus far, it has been observed that greater than 75% of predicted ccs values using this program falls within 3.0% error of experimental ccs values.

## Molecular Squeezer
#### This program takes a user selected squeeze value as a scaling factor to scale down the xyz cartesian coordinates for a desire peptide or protein structure. The objective here is to evaluate a compress (or a more compacted) version of a large peptide or a protein that may have been brought about by incidence of excluded volume effect due to macromolecular crowding.
